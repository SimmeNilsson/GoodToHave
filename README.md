# My Good To Have repo

This repository contains some stuff I found is good to have when developing JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

VS + Reshaper shortcuts => VS Code
I'm used to using Visual Studio with Resharper.
I've found that VS Code already contains similar functionality but under different keyboard shortcuts.
I've tried to reconfigure my favorite ones to match VS + Resharper.
